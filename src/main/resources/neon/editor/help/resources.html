<h1>Resource editing</h1>
Most of the data contained in a mod is in the form of <i>resources</i>. Maps 
are the only significant piece of information not implemented as an engine
resource. All resources are identified by an <i>ID</i>. Resources in the same 
namespace should have a different ID. Apart from the default namespace for 
creatures and items, the engine uses three other namespaces: <i>magic</i>,
<i>theme</i> and <i>terrain</i>.

<h2>Items and creatures</h2>
Item and creature resources can be found in the object tab at the right of the
editor window. To add resources, right click in the object tab on the type of
resource you want to add and select <b>New &lt;type of resource&gt;</b>. A 
dialog box will pop up asking for an ID for the new resource. If a valid ID was
given, the new resource will open in an editing window. To remove a resource, 
right click on the resource and select <b>Remove object</b>. To edit a 
resource, either right click on the resource and select <b>Edit object</b> or 
double click on the resource.

<h2>Terrain</h2>
Terrain resources can be found in the terrain tab at the right of the editor 
window. To add a terrain type, right click in the terrain tab and select 
<b>New terrain type</b>. A dialog box will pop up asking for an ID for the new 
terrain type. If a valid ID was given, an editing window will open. To remove 
a terrain type, right click on the resource and select <b>Delete terrrain 
type</b>. To edit a terrain type, double click on it.

<h2>Other resources</h2>
All other resources can be found under the resource tab at the right of the
editor window. Managing these resources is the same as managing item and 
creature resources.
<h3>Enchantments</h3>
Four types are available: <i>clothing</i>, <i>nutrition</i>, <i>trap</i> and
<i>weapon</i>. Clothing type enchantments can be used on both clothing and armor,
nutrition enchantments on food and potions, trap enchantments on doors and 
containers. Weapon type enchantments can only be used on weapons.
