<h1>The Fox as Herdsman</h1>
ONCE on a time there was a woman who went out to hire a herdsman, and she met a bear.
<p>
"Whither away, Goody?" said Bruin.
<p>
"Oh, I'm going out to hire a herdsman," answered the woman.
<p>
"Why not have me for a herdsman?" said Bruin.
<p>
"Well, why not?" said the woman. "If you only knew how to call the flock; just let me hear."
<p>
"OW, OW!" growled the bear.
<p>
"No, no! I won't have you," said the woman, as soon as she heard him say that, and off she went on her way.
<p>
So, when she had gone a bit farther, she met a wolf.
<p>
"Whither away, Goody?" asked the Wolf.
<p>
"Oh," said she, "I'm going out to hire a herdsman."
<p>
"Why not have me for a herdsman?" said the Wolf.
<p>
"Well, why not? if you can only call the flock; let me hear," said she.
<p>
"Uh, uh!" said the Wolf.
<p>
"No, no!" said the woman; "You'll never do for me."
<p>
Well, after she had gone a while longer, she met a fox.
<p>
"Whither away, Goody?" asked the Fox.
<p>
"Oh, I'm just going out to hire a herdsman," said the woman.
<p>
"Why not have me for your herdsman?" asked the Fox.
<p>
"Well, why not?" said she; "If you only knew how to call the flock; let me hear."
<p>
"Dil-dal-holom," sung out the Fox, in such a fine clear voice.
<p>
"Yes; I'll have you for my herdsman," said the woman; and so she set the Fox to herd her flock.
<p>
The first day the Fox was herdsman he ate up all the woman's goats; the next day he made an end of all her sheep; 
and the third day he ate up all her kine. So, when he came home at even, the woman asked what he had done with all her flocks?
<p>
"Oh!" said the Fox, "Their skulls are in the stream, and their bodies in the holt."
<p>
Now, the Goody stood and churned when the Fox said this, but she thought she might as well step out and see after her flock; 
and while she was away the Fox crept into the churn and ate up the cream. So when the Goody came back and saw that, she fell into such a rage, 
that she snatched up the little morsel of the cream that was left, and threw it at the Fox as he ran off, so that he got a dab of it on the end of his tail, 
and that's the reason why the fox has a white tip to his brush.
