<h1>Why the Bear is Stumpy-Tailed</h1>
<p>ONE day the Bear met the Fox, who came slinking along with a string of fish he had stolen.

<p>"Whence did you get those from?" asked the Bear.

<p>"Oh! My Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught them," said the Fox.

<p>So the Bear had a mind to learn to fish too, and bade the Fox tell him how he was to set about it.

<p>"Oh! It's an easy craft for you," answered the Fox, "and soon learnt. You've only got to go upon the 
ice, and cut a hole and stick your tail down into it; and so you must go on holding it there as long as 
you can. You're not to mind if your tail smarts a little; that's when the fish bite. The longer you hold 
it there, the more fish you'll get; and then all at once out with it, with a cross pull sideways, and 
with a strong pull too."

<p>Yes; the Bear did as the Fox had said, and held his tail a long, long time down in the hole, till it 
was fast frozen in. Then he pulled it out with a cross pull, and it snapped short off. That's why Bruin 
goes about with a stumpy tail this very day.
